## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- SQLAlchemy
- SQLite

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/restaurant-reviews.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd restaurant-reviews
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   On Windows:

   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   On macOS and Linux:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Create the SQLite database and tables by running the following command:

   ```bash
   python models.py
   ```

2. Add sample data to the database by running:

   ```bash
   python seed_data.py
   ```

3. You can now run the application. You can create your own Python script or use a framework like Flask to build a web interface for interacting with the database.

## Database Schema
